Whenever a page follows XML, it can be called an XML document. \n","- XML documents have sections, called *elements*, defined by a beginning and an ending *tag*. A tag is a markup construct that begins with `<` and ends with `>`. The characters between the start-tag and end-tag, if there are any, are the element's content. Elements can contain markup, including other elements, which are called \"child elements\".  \n","- The largest, top-level element is called the *root*, which contains all other elements.\n","- Attributes are name–value pair that exist within a start-tag or empty-element tag.
