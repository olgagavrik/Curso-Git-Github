It is mainly used in webpages, where the data has a specific structure and is understood dynamically by the XML framework. \n\nXML creates a tree-like structure that is easy to interpret and supports a hierarchy. Whenever a page follows XML, it can be called an XML document. \n- XML documents have sections, called *elements*, defined by a beginning and an ending *tag*. A tag is a markup construct that begins with `<` and ends with `>`. The characters between the start-tag and end-tag, if there are any, are the element's content. Elements can contain markup, including other elements, which are called \"child elements\".  \n- The largest, top-level element is called the *root*, which contains all other elements.\n- Attributes are name–value pair that exist within a start-tag or empty-element tag. An XML attribute can only have a single value and each attribute can appear at most once on each element.\n\nTo understand this a little bit better, take a look at the following (shortened) XML file:","metadata":{},"id":"popular-experiment","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<collection>\n\t<genre category=\"Action\">\n\t\t<decade years=\"1980s\">\n\t\t\t<movie favorite=\"True\" title=\"Indiana Jones: The raiders of the lost Ark\">\n\t\t\t\t<format multiple=\"No\">DVD</format>\n\t\t\t\t<year>1981</year>\n\t\t\t\t<rating>PG</rating>\n\t\t\t\t<description>\n\t\t\t\t'Archaeologist and adventurer Indiana Jones \n\t\t\t\tis hired by the U.S. government to find the Ark of the \n\t\t\t\tCovenant before the Nazis.'\n\t\t\t\t</description>\n\t\t\t</movie>\n\t\t   \t<movie favorite=\"True\" title=\"THE KARATE KID\">\n\t\t\t   <format multiple=\"Yes\">DVD,Online</format>\n\t\t\t   <year>1984</year>\n\t\t\t   <rating>PG</rating>\n\t\t\t   <description>None provided.</description>\n\t\t\t</movie>\n\t\t\t<movie favorite=\"False\" title=\"Back 2 the Future\">\n\t\t\t   <format multiple=\"False\">Blu-ray</format>\n\t\t\t   <year>1985</year>\n\t\t\t   <rating>PG</rating>\n\t\t\t   <description>Marty McFly</description>\n\t\t\t</movie>\n\t\t</decade>\n\t\t<decade years=\"1990s\">\n\t\t\t<movie favorite=\"False\" title=\"X-Men\">\n\t\t\t   <format multiple=\"Yes\">dvd, digital</format>\n\t\t\t   <year>2000</year>\n\t\t\t   <rating>PG-13</rating>\n\t\t\t   <description>Two mutants come to a private academy for their kind whose resident superhero team must \n\t\t\t   oppose a terrorist organization with similar powers.</description>\n\t\t\t</movie>\n\t\t\t<movie favorite=\"True\" title=\"Batman Returns\">\n\t\t\t   <format multiple=\"No\">VHS</format>\n\t\t\t   <year>1992</year>\n\t\t\t   <rating>PG13</rating>\n\t\t\t   <description>NA.</description>\n\t\t\t</movie>\n\t\t   \t<movie favorite=\"False\" title=\"Reservoir Dogs\">\n\t\t\t   <format multiple=\"No\">Online</format>\n\t\t\t   <year>1992</year>\n\t\t\t   <rating>R</rating>\n\t\t\t   <description>WhAtEvER I Want!!!?!</description>\n\t\t\t</movie>\n\t\t</decade>\t\n\t</genre>\n\t\n\t<genre category=\"Thriller\">\n\t\t<decade years=\"1970s\">\n\t\t\t<movie favorite=\"False\" title=\"ALIEN\">\n\t\t\t\t<format multiple=\"Yes\">DVD</format>\n\t\t\t\t<year>1979</year>\n\t\t\t\t<rating>R</rating>\n\t\t\t\t<description>\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"</description>\n\t\t\t</movie>\n\t\t</decade>\n\t\t<decade years=\"1980s\">\n\t\t\t<movie favorite=\"True\" title=\"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\">\n\t\t\t\t<format multiple=\"No\">DVD</format>\n\t\t\t\t<year>1986</year>\n\t\t\t\t<rating>PG13</rating>\n\t\t\t\t<description>Funny movie about a funny guy</description>\n\t\t\t</movie>\n\t\t\t<movie favorite=\"FALSE\" title=\"American Psycho\">\n\t\t\t\t<format multiple=\"No\">blue-ray</format>\n\t\t\t\t<year>2000</year>\n\t\t\t\t<rating>Unrated</rating>\n\t\t\t\t<description>psychopathic Bateman</description>\n\t\t\t</movie>\n\t\t</decade>\n\t</genre>\n```","metadata":{},"id":"functioning-peeing","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"From what you have read above, you see that\n- `<collection>` is the single root element: it contains all the other elements, such as `<genre>`, or `<movie>`, which are the child elements or subelements.

designate what values should be delineated there. Using smart structuring can make it easy to read and write to an XML. Tags always need opening and closing brackets to show the parent and children relationships.\n\nAttributes further describe how to validate a tag or allow for boolean designations. Attributes typically take very specific values so that the XML parser (and the user) can use the attributes to check the tag values.\n\n`ElementTree` is an important Python library that allows you to parse and navigate an XML document. Using `ElementTree` breaks down the XML document in a tree structure that is easy to work with. When in doubt, print it out (`print(ET.tostring(root, encoding='utf8').decode('utf8'))`) - use this helpful print statement to view the entire XML document at once. It helps to check when editing, adding, or removing from an XML.\n\nNow you are equipped to understand XML and begin parsing!","metadata":{},"id":"hidden-rough","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"*References:*\n\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML","metadata":{},"id":"endless-central","cell_type":"markdown"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.5"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
